how transistor store data?

1 bit = Binary
8 bit = 1 bytes
1024 bytes = 1 KB
1024 kb = 1 MB
1024 MB = 1 GB
2^10 GB = 1 TB
2^10 TB = 1 PB

how do we store values A, B, C?
assign values to it. for e.g.

A -> 65
B -> 66
C -> 67

ASCII Table -> allocates every character a specific value

how to represent -2 in binary?

step0. write binary value
step1. take 1's complement 
step2. take 2's complement

binary -> 010 (stored in 3 bitsa )
1's complement -> 101 (converting 0 to 1 and 1 to 0)
2's complement -> 110 (add + 1 to 1's complement)

1 1 0 1 1 -> least significant bit

most significant bit

if most significant bit is zero, the number is positive
if most significant bit is one, the number is negative

for 3 bits
8 different numbers can be stored
1. negative ->  {-1,-2,-3,-4} i.e -2^(2)
2. positive -> {0,1,2,3} i.e. 2^(2) - 1
